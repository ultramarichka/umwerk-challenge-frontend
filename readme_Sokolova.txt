for this challenge I've used LAMP (Apache 2.4.18)
My *host* file '000-default.conf' is Apache's folder with the path /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
it works in case I have my project in a folder with path /var/www/html/umwerk-challenge-frontend/

Also
I've changed 'dir.conf' file with the path /etc/apache2/mods-available/dir.conf

And I had to do some changes in .htaccess file that locates in the *web* folder
